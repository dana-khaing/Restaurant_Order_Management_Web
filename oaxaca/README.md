Oaxaca's Restaurant Management System is a Next.js-based frontend application, designed to enhance the customer service experience in the growing Oaxaca restaurant chain. It utilizes the power and flexibility of Next.js along with the styling capabilities of Tailwind CSS and the dynamic interactivity of React.

- **Component Design**: Write reusable, efficient, and stateless functional components wherever possible.
- **Styling**: Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling. Aim for consistency and responsiveness across various devices.
- **State Management**: Manage local and global states effectively using React's Context API or other state management libraries if needed.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage Next.js features like dynamic imports, image optimization, and server-side rendering for a faster and more efficient application.
- **Security Practices**: Ensure secure handling of data and API requests.
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Code Quality**: Adhere to best coding practices, including readable code, proper documentation, and regular code reviews.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control with clear commit messages and organized branches.
