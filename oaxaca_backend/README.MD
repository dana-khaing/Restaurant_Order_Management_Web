# Oaxaca Backend - Project README

## Project Overview

The Oaxaca Backend is a robust and scalable microservices architecture powered by Spring Boot, designed to manage the diverse functionalities of a restaurant management system. The backend facilitates seamless integration of various services like customer management, waiter service, and kitchen staff coordination.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot**: For rapid application development and effortless configuration.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design for independent service development, deployment, and scalability.
- **Database Integration**: Utilize JPA and Hibernate for database interactions.
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs for smooth communication between frontend and backend.
- **Security**: Implement Spring Security for secure API endpoints.

## Development Guidelines

- **Microservice Design**: Develop loosely coupled services with clear, bounded contexts.
- **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger for API documentation and testing.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- **Database Management**: Ensure efficient and secure handling of database transactions.
- **Testing**: Prioritize writing extensive unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Employ CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Code Quality**: Follow best practices in code writing, like clear naming conventions, DRY principle, and proper commenting.

## Running the Project

- Set up each microservice with necessary configurations.
- Use Maven commands like `mvn clean install` to build the projects.
- Run the Spring Boot application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the main class.
